# Redash Add-On - LLM Chatbot for Advanced Analytics and Visualization

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a novel Redash chat add-on that enables users to extract insights from multiple Redash dashboards and connected databases using natural language. This chatbot add-on will facilitate seamless conversation in a question and answer format, allowing users to autonomously discover knowledge and obtain deep, meaningful, and actionable insights from business intelligence (BI) platforms.

## Project Scope
The project scope includes the following key features:
- Development of a Redash add-on in the frontend
- Implementation of an intelligent backend that can translate user queries into the following:
  - Summary of visualizations in the current dashboard
  - Insights about data returned by existing SQL queries
  - Auto-generation of SQL queries and visualizations
  - Auto-generation of new Redash dashboards from existing and auto-generated SQL queries and their associated visualizations

## Motivation
Our company's BI dashboards serve the purpose of monitoring business processes and transforming data collected from various systems such as YouTube, Slack, and Gmeet into actionable insights. This project will leverage the Redash Add-On - LLM Chatbot to drive strategic decision-making and gain a competitive edge by understanding digital content consumption trends.

## Key Benefits
- Democratizes data analytics by translating natural language queries into complex SQL queries
- Empowers team members with non-technical backgrounds to easily extract and visualize data without deep knowledge of SQL
- Streamlines analytical processes, making data exploration more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly
- Facilitates the integration of the add-on with Redash, enhancing the overall analytical capabilities of the platform
- Enables knowledge discovery through autonomous querying and exploration of connected databases

## Data Sources
The project will utilize the following data sources:
- Video metadata for all videos uploaded to our YouTube channel
- Time Series viewership metadata for all videos uploaded to our YouTube channel
- Time Series comments for all videos uploaded to our YouTube channel
- Time Series transcribed text for selected videos uploaded to our YouTube channel
